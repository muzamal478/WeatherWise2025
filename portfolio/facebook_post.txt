🌟 Wrapped up my Python Programming Internship at BKR Tech Solutions with WeatherWise CLI App! 🌦️ A journey from basic API setup to advanced features like async fetching, rich visuals, and exports.

Learned: aiohttp for 70% faster API calls, rich for stunning CLI tables with icons ☀️🌧️, yaml configs, pandas exports, and CI testing. Proud to share!
