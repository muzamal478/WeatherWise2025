🚀 Just completed my Python Programming Internship at @BKR Tech Solutions with WeatherWise CLI App! 🌦️ From API setup to async fetching, rich visuals, and exports—learned a ton!

Week 3 highlights: 70% faster responses with aiohttp, rich tables with weather icons ☀️🌧️, yaml configs, and CI testing. Built for real-world use!
